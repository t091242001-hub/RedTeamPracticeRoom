# RedTeamPracticeRoom
1. 關於紅隊演練/滲透測試/OSCP考試的紀錄房，以繁體中文書寫。
2. Write-up是模仿專業滲透測試報告，並保留傳統Write-up風格製成，參考了noraj的OSCP-exam-report-template_whoisflynn_v3.2，並由我自行簡化而來，範本請見:Machine_Write-Up/ sample.md。
3. Penetration_tips裡是我在學習過程中的零碎筆記，不會記載我當下已經知道的知識，我會盡量整理。

1. The record room regarding the red team/penetration testing/OSCP exam is written in Taiwan Mandarin.
2. The write-up is modeled after a professional penetration test report and retains the traditional write-up style. It is based on noraj's OSCP-exam-report-template_whoisflynn_v3.2 and is simplified by me. The template can be found at: Machine_Write-Up/sample.md.
3. The Penetration_tips section contains my scattered notes from the learning process. It will not record the knowledge I already knew at the moment I encountered it, but I will try my best to organize them.
