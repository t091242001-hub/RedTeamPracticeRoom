# RedTeamPracticeRoom
1. 關於紅隊演練/滲透測試/OSCP考試的紀錄房，以繁體中文書寫。
2. Write-up的格式參考了noraj的OSCP-exam-report-template_whoisflynn_v3.2，範本請見:Machine_Write-Up/ sample.md。
3. Penetration_tips裡是我在學習過程中的零碎筆記，不會記載我當下已經知道的知識，我會盡量整理。

1. The record room regarding the red team/penetration testing/OSCP exam is written in Taiwan Mandarin.
2. The format of the write-up is based on noraj's OSCP-exam-report-template_whoisflynn_v3.2. For the template, please see: Machine_Write-Up/sample.md.
3. The Penetration_tips section contains my scattered notes from the learning process. It will not record the knowledge I already knew at the moment I encountered it, but I will try my best to organize them.
